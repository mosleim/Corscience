This project demonstrates how to connect to Corscience EMB1 (two channel ecg acquisition device). for the visualization purpose I have used canvas/html5 application implemented in javascript, the connector application allows the web based application to connect to the EMB1 via USB virtual serial port.

It implements the Corscience protocol and so on...
